## Example variables. These should be filled in for the specific of your own
## nodes and environment.

## Variables controlling how to initially log into the nodes.
# Existing default user account to ssh into the node as initially.
ansible_ssh_user: "ubuntu"
# Password to ssh into the node as initially.
ansible_ssh_pass: "ubuntu"
# Password to become root with. Use in conjunction with ansible_become_method.
ansible_become_pass: "ubuntu"
# Method to become root using. Should either be "sudo" or "su".
ansible_become_method: "sudo"

## Variables controlling the user account to be used by PCC to manage the nodes.
# User to be used by PCC to manage the nodes. Usually 'pcc'.
orchestration_user: "pcc"
# Public OpenSSH key for orchestration_user to trust to allow management by PCC.
# This may be a URL, or may be the actual key string. Only supports a single
# key today.
# PCC makes its public SSH key available over HTTP, so simply replacing the
# hostname below should suffice for most cases.
orchestration_pubkey: "http://mypcc.example.com:8989/files/download/id_rsa_ansible_pub"
# Or the public key can be explicitly provided as a string instead:
# orchestration_pubkey: "..."
